Do you know the number of Markdown flavours in the world? Everyone has an own flavour. It's hard to find the suitable
Markdown previewer for your own flavored Markdown.

Glance Vim is YOUR previewer. You do not to wander anymore. Because this plugin provides a mechanism to customize
renderer using markdown-it plugins.

If you want to use emoji in the markdown, then you just need to append `markdown-it-emoji` to `g:glance#plugins`

```vim
let g:glance#markdown_plugins = ['https://esm.sh/markdown-it-emoji']
```

The renderer dynamically loads your plugin with _dynamic import_ in Deno, then it renders the buffer content with
_markdown-it_, and finally it sends the HTML document to the browwser.

Of couse, Glance Vim also provide features as follows.

- Spy the cursor motion in Vim.
- Append custom preamble in a head of HTML output.
- Synchronize content between the buffer and the browser.
- Offline mode, Deno caches the markdown-it plugins.

Let's write document in your own flavoured Markdown.
